unfortunately, a lambda function in a VPC does not have internet access nor public IP. From docs:

Connecting a function to a public subnet does not give it internet access or a public IP address.

Therefore, when you use boto3:

    client = session.client(
        service_name='secretsmanager',
        region_name=region_name
    )
to connect to the Secrets Manager it times out, because boto3 can't connect to the Secrets Manager manager from the VPC.

There are two ways to rectify this:

Place your function in a private subnet and use NAT gateway/instance with correctly configured route tables to provide the internet access, 
and consequently, to the Secrets Manager.

Setup VPC interface endpoint for Secrets Manager in a private subnet. 
This way your lambda function will be able to connect to the Secrets Manager using the endpoint, without needing the internet.
